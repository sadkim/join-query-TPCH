# FDE Bonus Project - join-query-TPCH


## Task

Implement the **_avg function_** and **_constructor_** in `src/JoinQuery.cpp`. 
See the corresponding header `include/JoinQuery.hpp` for documentation of this function. 
All solutions that compute correct results and achieve a time measurement better than **6.5 seconds** on the leaderboard 
will be accepted for the bonus.

The performance evaluation will run the binary compiled from `main.cpp` so that the avg query is run for multiple 
market segments on a _TPC-H dataset_ with scale factor 1. 
The overall runtime from start to end is measured.<br>
Details about the machine this will be executed on: <br>
`Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz with 4 cores, 8 hyperthreads and 32GB of memory`

You can use the test provided in `test/JoinQuery.cpp` to check if your implementation works
correctly.

When you do performance tuning, you may use and extend the benchmark suite in `bench/JoinQuery.cpp`.

## Build
A configuration file is provided to build this project with CMake. This allows you to build the project
in the terminal but also provides the option to use Jetbrains CLion or Microsoft Visual Studio and other
IDEs.

Building from Terminal:
Start in the project directory.
```
mkdir -p build/debug
cd build/debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
make
```

This creates the binaries `test_all`, `bench` and `main`.
